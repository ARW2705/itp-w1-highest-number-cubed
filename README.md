# [itp-w1] Highest Number Cubed

Sometimes you can use programming to solve problems that would otherwise be difficult.
For example, can you think of the highest number that, when cubed, is less than 12,000?
Even using a calculator you would probably have to manually guess numbers until you figure it out. 
Write a program that receives an upper limit and figures this out for you!

All students will fork this repo and set up their cloud9 for this project individually with guidance from the mentor.


```python
>>> highest_number_cubed(30)
'3'
>>> highest_number_cubed(3)
'1'
```
